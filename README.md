1. What is Fortifier

Fortifier is an existing word that has several meaning including the following meaning: to give emotional, moral, or mental strength

to; encourage according to the dictionary.com. Also, this is a compound word that we created by adding Fortune and Identifier.

Thus, we hope our app can give emotional, moral or mental strength to our users by providing daily or yearly fortune service.

2. Overview

In Asian countries, fortune telling is very popular. However, we rarely try to find our fortune in the Western world. That is why we

came up with idea about Fortifier. We are planning to make an app that tells someone’s fortune by using their zodiac signs, saju, or

the Tarot cards. A user will be asked to provide his/her date of birth. The app then will create an object using this information and

store it. Our first goal is to provide daily fortune using people’s zodiac signs. Until we create our own database for daily fortune, we

will use data from https://www.ganeshaspeaks.com.  When we accomplish this goal, we will try to implement Tarot cards method.

And our final goal is to implement the idea of “saju” which can tell user’s daily or yearly fortune by their date of birth.

3. Next Step

For now, our app can tell our user’s fortune using their zodiac sign and simple tarot card game. But what we really want to

accomplish is use the idea of saju in our app. In order to do that, we need to build our database and come up with some creative

ideas in order to make people who are new to the idea of saju can understand what our app is doing.
